log in the source code repository.

What's new in v1.1
==================

- PyPI binary distribution 

  - supports MacOS (Intel and Apple Silicon architectures) and Manylinux (x86_64)
  - supports both PyPy and CPython
  - PyPI package here: https://pypi.org/project/charm4py/

- Add a Ray Core API implementation on Charm4py

  - Ray is a framework for distributed AI and Python applications (https://docs.ray.io/)
  - the Charm4py Ray API allows users to run Ray programs with Charm4py background with minimal changes

- Fixes reductions over a section, use of futures in threaded entry methods
- Reduce message latency for builtin Numpy datatypes
- Disabled local message optimization which broke Charm++ semantics in some
  cases
- Use a `@register` decorator for registering Chares instead of passing them
  as a list to `charm.start`
- Migrate build system to pyproject.toml
- Fix build on ARM-based machines
- Update Cython support, now requires Cython 3.0.0


What's new in v1.0
==================

This is a major release, containing API changes, many new features, bug fixes
and performance improvements. The highlights are:

- Many improvements that simplify how Charm4py programs are written.
  There have been API changes, but most of the old API is preserved for
  backward compatibility. Please consult the documentation if you
  encounter any issues, and consider migrating to the new API.

- **Coroutines**: threaded entry methods are now referred to as coroutines (which is a more
  common term) and the appropiate way to declare them is with the new
  ``@coro`` decorator.

  - Significant performance improvement of coroutines, now implemented using the
    greenlet package.

- **Channels**: can establish channels between arbitrary pairs of chares, and use
  them to send/receive data inside coroutines.

- **Sections**: it is now possible to split, slice and combine chare collections
  in arbitrary ways, to form new collections called *sections*, containing some
  subset or combination of elements. Sections are referenced by section proxies, and the usual operations
  of broadcast and reductions are supported (uses efficient multicast trees
  that only involve the PEs where the section elements are located).

- Can now create Groups that are constrained to certain PEs, for example:
  ``g = Group(MyChare, onPEs=[0,4,8...])``. This uses the sections implementation
  underneath.

- Keyword arguments are now correctly supported when calling remote methods.

- Added ``charm.wait(awaitables)`` that waits for the given objects to become
  ready (works for futures and channels).

- Added ``charm.iwait(awaitables)`` that iteratively yields objects as they
  become ready (works for futures and channels).

- Huge rewrite and revision of examples to use new features (like coroutines
  and channels), and added documentation and comments. New examples added.

- Same applies to the tutorial and large parts of the documentation.

- Added ARM support (tested on Raspberry Pi 3 B+).

- **Pool**: added an interface to create single tasks. Tasks themselves can spawn
  any number of other tasks. Python functions decorated with ``@coro`` can be
  used as tasks that can wait for messages, other tasks to complete, etc.

- Added Quiescence Detection (QD) support. Please see the manual and tutorial for
  more information.

- Can now use Futures and proxy methods as *callbacks*, that is: *callable* objects
  that can be sent to other chares, and which those chares can call to send
  values back. For example: ``someproxy[3].somemethod`` is a valid callback that can
  be sent (requires Python 3+).

- The ``ret=True`` keyword argument now has the same semantics for broadcast calls
  as for point-to-point calls: the future will receive the return values.
  For the broadcast case, it will be a list of return values
  (of all the called elements), sorted by element index.

- Added ``awaitable`` keyword argument to proxy calls, to wait for completion
  without sending return values to the caller.

- Better method to update globals: ``charm.updateGlobals(dict, module_name)``
  is a remote method that can be called to update global values on any PE at
  any time (typically used as a broadcast call). It has the same rules and semantics
  as any other proxy call, so it can be waited upon.

- Distributed exception handling: if a future is requested when invoking remote
  methods (using ``awaitable=True`` or ``ret=True``) and an exception happens
  in the remote method, it is propagated to the caller.

- **Interactive mode**: several QOL improvements. Note that we consider this mode to still
  be in beta, and encourage feedback. Some highlights:

  - Improved launch process for interactive mode. Now also works with charmrun
    in ssh mode (which can be used to launch an interactive session using multiple hosts).

  - Can automatically broadcast import statements to other PEs (on by default).

  - Can automatically broadcast and register Chare definitions (on by default).

  - Exceptions (whether local or remote) should not crash the interactive
    session anymore (thanks to distributed exception handling mentioned above).

- Chares now have a method called ``migrated`` that applications can redefine
  to get notified when a chare has migrated.

- Added ``Chare.setMigratable(bool)`` to indicate whether a chare that is part
  of an Array can be migrated or not.

- All proxies implement ``__eq__`` and ``__hash__``, with correct results
  between proxies generated locally and those obtained from a remote PE.
  This allows, for example, checking proxies for equality, using them as
  dictionary keys or inserting in sets.

What's new in v0.12.3
=====================

* Fixed some bugs in charm.pool, one of which could cause charm.pool to hang
  when tasks return None.


What's new in v0.12.2
=====================

* Fixed a bug which decreased the performance of charm.pool, and could result
  in high memory usage in some circumstances.

* Added API to obtain information on nodes, for example: the number of nodes on
  which the application is running, or the first PE of each node.

* Expanded topology-aware tree API to allow obtaining the subtrees of a given
  PE in a topology-based spanning tree.


What's new in v0.12
===================

* Added experimental charm.pool library which is similar to Python's
  multiprocessing Pool, but also works in a distributed setting (multiple hosts),
  tasks can create other tasks all of which use the same shared pool,
  and can benefit from Charm++'s support for efficient communication layers
  such as MPI. See documentation for more information.

* Improved support for building and running with Charm++'s MPI communication
  layer. See Install and Running sections of the documentation for more information.

* Substantially improved the performance of threaded entry methods by allowing
  thread reuse.

* Blocking allreduce and barrier is now supported inside threaded entry methods:
  ``result = charm.allReduce(data, reducer, self)`` and ``charm.barrier(self)``.

* Can now indicate if array elements use AtSync at array creation time
  by passing ``useAtSync=True`` in Array creation method.

* Minor bugfixes and improvements.


What's new in v0.11
===================

* Changed the name of the project from CharmPy to *charm4py* (more information on why
  we changed the name is in the forum).

* Not directly related to this release, but there is a new forum for charm4py discussions
  (see contact details). Feel free to visit the forum for discussions, reports,
  provide feedback, request features and to follow development.

* Support for interactive charm4py shell using multiple processes on one host has been added
  as a *beta* feature. Please provide feedback and suggestions in the forum or GitHub.

* Uses the recent major release of Charm++ (6.9)

* C-extension module can be built on Windows. Windows binary wheels on PyPI come with
  the compiled extension module.

* API change: method ``Chare.gather()`` has been removed to make the name available
  for user-defined remote methods. Use ``self.contribute(data, Reducer.gather, ...)``
  instead.

* Some methods of ``charm`` are now remotely callable, like ``charm.exit()``.
  They can be used as any other remote method including as targets of reductions.
  For example: ``self.contribute(None, None, charm.thisProxy[0].exit)``

* Can now use Python exit function instead of ``charm.exit()``

* Other small fixes and improvements.


What's new in v0.10.1
=====================

This is a bugfix and documentation release:

* Added core API to docs, and more details regarding installation and running

* Fixed reduction to Future failing when contributing numeric arrays

* Charm4py now requires Charm++ version >= ``6.8.2-890`` which, among other things,
  includes fixes for the following Windows issues:

      - Running an application without ``charmrun`` on Windows would crash

      - Abort messages were sometimes not displayed on exit. On Charm4py,
        this had the effect that Python runtime errors were sometimes not shown.

      - If running with charmrun, any output prior to charm.start()
        would not be shown. On Charm4py, this had the effect that Python
        syntax errors were not shown.


What's new in v0.10
===================

**Installation and Setup**

* Charm4py can be installed with pip (``pip install charm4py``) on regular
  Linux, macOS and Windows systems

* Support setuptools to build, install, and package Charm4py

* Installation from source is much simpler (see documentation)

* charm4py builds include the charm++ library and are relocatable. ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` or
  similar schemes are no longer needed.

* charm4py does not need a configuration file anymore (it will automatically
  select the best available interface layer at runtime).


**API Changes**

* Start API is now ``charm.start(entry)``, where ``entry`` can be a regular
  Python function, or any chare type. Special Mainchare class is no longer needed.


**Performance**

* Added Cython-based C-extension module to considerably speed up the interface with
  the Charm++ library and critical parts of charm4py (currently only with Python 3+).

* Several minor performance improvements


**Features**

* *Threaded entry methods*: entry methods can run in their own thread when tagged
  with the ``@threaded`` decorator. This enables `direct style programming`__ with
  asynchronous remote method execution (also see Futures):

    - The entry point (main function or chare) is automatically threaded by default

    - Added ``charm.awaitCreation(*proxies)`` to wait for Group and Array creation
      within the threaded entry method that created them

    - Added ``self.wait('condition')`` construct to suspend entry method execution until a condition is
      met

* *Futures*

    - Remote method invocations can optionally return futures with the ``ret``
      keyword: ``future = proxy.method(ret=True)``. Also works for broadcasts.
    - A future can be queried to obtain the value with ``future.get()``. This will
      block if the value has not yet been received.
    - Futures can be explicitly created using ``future = charm.createFuture()``,
      and passed to other chares. Chares can send values to the future by calling
      ``future.send(value)``
    - Futures can be used as reduction targets

* Simplified ``@when`` decorator syntax and enhanced to support general conditions
  involving a chare's state and remote method arguments. New syntax is ``@when('condition')``.

* Can now pass arguments to chare constructors

* Can create singleton chares. Syntax is ``proxy = Chare(MyChare, pe)``

* ArrayMap: to customize initial mapping of chares to cores

* Warn if user forgot to call ``charm.start()`` when launching charm4py programs

* Exposed ``migrateMe(toPe)`` method of chares to manually migrate a chare to indicated
  PE

* Exposed `LBTurnInstrumentOn/Off`__ from Charm++ to charm4py applications

* Interface to construct topology-aware trees of nodes/PEs


**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed issues related to migration of chares


**Documentation**

* Updated documentation and tutorial to reflect changes in installation, setup,
  addition of Futures and API changes

* Added leanmd results to benchmarks section


**Examples and Tests**

* Improved performance of ``stencil3d_numba.py``, and added better benchmarking support
* Added parallel map example (``examples/parallel-map/parmap.py``)
* Improved output and scaling of several tests when launched with many (> 100)
  PEs
* Cleaned, updated, simplified several tests and examples by using futures


**Profiling**

* Fixed issues which resulted in inaccurate timings in some circumstances
* Profiling of chare constructors (including main chare and chares that
  are migrating in) is now supported


**Code**

* Code has been structured as a Python package

* Heavy code refactoring. Code simplification in several places

* Several improvements towards PEP 8 compliance of core charm4py code.
  Indentation of code in ``charm4py`` package is PEP 8 compliant.

* Improvements to test infrastructure and added Travis CI script

What's new in v0.9
==================

**General**

* Charm4py is compatible with Python 3 (Python 3 is the recommended option)

* Added documentation (http://charm4py.readthedocs.io)


**API Changes**

* New API to create chares and collections:
  all chare types are defined by inheriting from Chare.
  To create a group: ``group_proxy = Group(MyChare)``.
  To create an array: ``array_proxy = Array(MyChare, ...)``.

* Simplified program start API with automatic registration of chares


**Performance**

* Bypass pickling of common array types (most notably numpy arrays) by directly
  copying contents of their buffer into messages. This can result in substantial
  performance improvement.

* Added optional CFFI-based layer to access Charm++ library, that is faster than
  existing ctypes layer.

* The ``LOCAL_MSG_OPTIM`` option (True by default) avoids copying and serializing
  messages that are directed to an object in the same process. Works for all chare
  types.


**Features**

* Support reductions over chare arrays/groups, including defining custom reducers.
  Numpy arrays and numbers can be passed as data and will be efficiently reduced.
  Added "gather" reducer.

* Support dynamic insertion into chare arrays

* Allow using int as index of 1D chare array

* ``element_proxy = proxy[index]`` syntax now returns a new independent proxy object to
  an individual element

* Added ``@when('attrib_name')`` decorator to entry methods so that they are invoked
  only when the first argument matches the value of the specified chare's attribute


* Added methods ``charm.myPe()``, ``charm.numPes()``, ``charm.exit()`` and
  ``charm.abort()`` as alternatives to CkMyPe, CkNumPes, CkExit and CkAbort


**Other**

* Improved profiling output. Profiling is disabled by default.

* Improved general error handling and output. Errors in charm4py runtime raise
  ``Charm4PyError`` exception.

* Code Examples:

    - Updated stencil3d examples to use the ``@when`` construct

    - Added particle example (uses the ``@when`` construct)

    - Add total iterations as program parameter for wave2d

* Added ``auto_test.py`` script to test charm4py
